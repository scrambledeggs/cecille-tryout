Hi Cecille,

Your task for today is to create a simple Rails application. We're doing this in order to get a feel for how you work. Don't hesitate to ask questions. 

Here are the specs for you project:

The canteen across the street would like to offer an easy way for diners to see their menu and to pre-order meals. You will build a web app where:

1. An admin can enter the menu or list of dishes and their prices for the day
    -  (optional) allow the admin to upload a photo of the dishes
2. A user can view the menu for the day
3. A user can add items to their cart/tray and submit it for pre-order
    - allow user to indicate pick-up time

4. An admin can mark orders as paid and claimed once an order has been settled

5.  An admin can view a summary of orders in the dashboard

6. (optional) Write tests for your code using a test framework you are comfortable with

Clone this repo and commit your work into this repo. We are also looking at the sizes and messages of your commits, so be mindful of that.

When you're done, or at 5PM, (whichever comes earlier), you can demo your work to the team and explain what you did and why you built your app this way.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask any of us anytime.

Cheers,
The Booky Tech Team
